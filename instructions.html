				<h3>Asymptomatic cases or mild cases of COVID-19</h3>
				<p>
					Asymptomatic cases; mild cases of COVID-19
					The asymptomatic cases are laboratory confirmed cases not experiencing any symptoms and having oxygen saturation at room air of more than 94%. Clinically assigned mild cases are patients with upper respiratory tract symptoms (&/or fever) without shortness of breath and having oxygen saturation at room air of more than 94%.
				</p>
